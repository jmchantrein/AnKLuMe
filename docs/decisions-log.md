# Decisions Log

Autonomous implementation decisions made during development.
This file tracks choices made **without human review** — decisions where
the AI agent had to make a judgment call during autonomous work.

Each decision documents:
- The problem encountered
- The choice made and alternatives considered
- The rationale

The human reviews these decisions and validates (y), rejects (n), or
comments (c) during interactive sessions. Validated decisions are
promoted to ADRs in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) if architectural,
or documented in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) / [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) if
implementation-level.

For architecture-level decisions, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
(ADR-001 to ADR-031).
